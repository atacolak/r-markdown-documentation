# Applications of Classification, Clustering, Data Wrangling and Computations Using R Markdown

## I created this repository to document my machine learning journey using programming language R, and formatting the codes using R Markdown. This repository includes applications of popular machine learning libraries in R such as:

### "rpart",
### "rpart.plot",
### "xgboost", 
### "class" and others.



## Each folder includes several code chunks which explain the processes in detail, including:

### The links to access the datasets,
### Names of libraries used,
### Determining different ways to plot and use algorithms depending on the data and application, and
### Brainstorming on the way ML algorithms work.



## I would suggest going through vector and matrix computations, then regression, before diving into classification, clustering and data wrangling.
